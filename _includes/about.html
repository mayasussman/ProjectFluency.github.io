                <h4>The Problem</h4>
                <p> There are 23 million adults in the United States with limited English proficiency. For them, language limits day-to-day life, access to jobs they are otherwise skilled for, even the ability to help their kids succeed in school.  </p>

                <p> While adult English learners frequently encounter English speakers in their day-to-day lives, they often lack the confidence to practice speaking English outside a classroom setting. </p>

                <h4>Our Mission</h4>

                <p> Project Fluency helps adult English learners become confident English speakers. </p>
                <p> We help learners increase their confidence speaking English by providing practical content for everyday conversations, and structuring daily speaking practice into their lives. </p>

                <h4>The Solution</h4>

                <p> We partner with ESL classes and English conversation clubs to deliver practical conversational content, augmented by daily nudges to help learners build a habit of practicing English in their everyday lives. The result is a positive feedback loop that improves both confidence and English proficiency over time. </p>
